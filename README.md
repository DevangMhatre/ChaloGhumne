Yes, this is the React Project which I had a lot of fun, this project was already COMPLETED but as I am starting from scratch again and this project was perfect from the course i had previously learned, I had to do again. I had a lot of fun in doing things on my own and not mention the feeling of CSS working properly on most of the first tryâ€¦â€¦â€¦. AHAHAHA! âœ‹ðŸ¤š
[Still couldn't come up with my own CSS]
